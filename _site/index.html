<h3 id="what-got-done">What got done</h3>

<p>The project consisted of three parts:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Make search better by introducing additional search filters. (e.g., tags, notebook, type)</li>
  <li>Make the ranking of search results better by implementing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25">Okapi BM25</a> relevance function.</li>
  <li>Make fuzzy search possible.</li>
</ol>

  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/3213"><strong>All: Add search filters</strong></a><br />
 Joplin’s search had been using the Full-Text Search(FTS) offered by SQLite directly. So though it was fast, it was not versatile. For example, we can’t restrict the search scope to a particular notebook or search based on tags.</p>

    <p>The current search implementation fixes most of these problems. It provides a better abstraction over FTS, supporting many new filters. The documentation for the new search filters can be found <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin#searching">here.</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/3454"><strong>All: Weigh notes using Okapi BM25 score</strong></a> <br />
 Joplin used a ranking function based on the number of times the search query occurs in the note and how close they are.</p>

    <p>But there are better ways to rank notes, considering not just the number of times a word appears, but how common it is. Words like “the” is in most notes, while words like “zebra” are not common and should be considered more relevant.</p>

    <p>The new search implementation uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25">Okapi BM25</a> as the ranking function. It ranks a set of documents based on the query terms appearing in each document, regardless of their proximity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/3632"><strong>Desktop: Fuzzy search</strong></a><br />
 We’ve added support for fuzzy search. It doesn’t replace the need to put * at the end if you want to do a prefix search. But it does let you be a bit more relaxed about the exact spelling. Searching for “tomatos” will also give you results for “tomatoes”. (This feature isn’t released yet, but will be soon)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>It was a pleasure working with <a href="https://github.com/laurent22">Laurent</a> and <a href="https://github.com/CalebJohn">Caleb</a>. They did an excellent job as mentors.</p>
